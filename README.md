# Business Insights 360 – AtliQ Hardwares (Power BI Project)

## 📌 Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardwares, a global consumer electronics company, was experiencing rapid growth but still relied heavily on Excel for analytics. This led to fragmented reports, delayed insights, and even a significant business loss in the Latin American market. Leadership needed a centralized BI solution to unify Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain data under one platform.

## 🎯 The Mission
To design a CEO-ready, multi-dashboard Power BI solution that delivers real-time KPIs, trend analysis, and performance breakdowns — enabling faster, data-driven decisions across all departments.

## ⚡ Solution
I developed the **Business Insights 360 Dashboard** in Power BI, providing:
- 💰 **Finance View** – P&L by product, country, and customer  
- 📈 **Sales View** – Profitability and growth metrics by customer & product  
- 🎯 **Marketing View** – Performance matrix by product segment  
- 🚚 **Supply Chain View** – Forecast accuracy, net error trends, and risk profiling  
- 🧠 **Executive View** – Consolidated leadership dashboard with KPIs and market share  
- ℹ️ **Info View** – Key references and data refresh guidelines  
- 🆘 **Support View** – Guidance, feedback, and contingency plan
